| Date | Goal | Accomplished |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nov 7, 2021 | | I can now enter 'ctl + n' to split the box into two equal sized boxes.  |
| Nov 9, 2021 |  | Can make & destroy up to 4 windows. Cleaned up the logic a bit. Next steps are to figure out header and footer banners & some UI stuff  |
| Nov 14, 2021 | Add a system to add text on the top & bottom and maybe add text in each individual screen | Added a CursesString class, and a status string that shows commands on the bottom. Todo next time: get a unified way to adjust the box size based on the header/bottom strings|
| Nov 15, 2021 | Add a context handler to focus on one window or another | |
